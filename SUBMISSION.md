# Perplexity CLI - Submission Details

## Time Spent & Approach

I spent approximately 1 hour on this implementation, focusing on:

1. **Core Functionality (40%)**: Building the search integration and AI response generation with proper citation handling
2. **User Experience (30%)**: Creating a polished CLI interface with Rich library for beautiful terminal output
3. **Performance (20%)**: Implementing caching to reduce API calls and improve response times
4. **Documentation (10%)**: Writing clear setup instructions and code documentation

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns into distinct modules (search_engine, ai_processor, cache_manager)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages
- **Caching System**: Simple file-based cache with TTL to balance performance and freshness

### Libraries Chosen
- **Click**: Industry-standard CLI framework, clean and declarative
- **Rich**: Modern terminal formatting for enhanced UX
- **SerpAPI**: Reliable search API with good free tier
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4o-mini for fast, cost-effective responses

### AI Techniques Employed

1. **Contextual Synthesis**: The AI is given all search results as context to generate comprehensive answers
2. **Citation Extraction**: Regex-based parsing ensures accurate source attribution
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Carefully crafted system prompts ensure the AI:
   - Always cites sources
   - Acknowledges when information is limited
   - Provides structured, clear responses

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Dual Mode Operation**: Interactive REPL or single-query CLI
2. **Rich Terminal UI**: Color-coded output, progress indicators, formatted tables
3. **Smart Caching**: Reduces API costs and improves response time for repeated queries
4. **Flexible Citations**: Inline citations with source linking
5. **Comprehensive Search Results**: Shows both AI synthesis and raw search results

## What I Would Add With More Time

### Technical Improvements
1. **Streaming Responses**: Stream AI responses as they're generated for better UX
2. **Parallel Processing**: Query multiple search engines simultaneously
3. **Local LLM Support**: Integration with Ollama for privacy-conscious users
4. **Advanced Search Filters**: Date ranges, site-specific searches, file type filters
5. **Export Functionality**: Save sessions to Markdown/PDF/JSON

### AI Enhancements
1. **Multi-turn Conversations**: Maintain context across queries
2. **Source Quality Ranking**: AI evaluation of source credibility
3. **Fact Checking**: Cross-reference claims across multiple sources
4. **Summarization Modes**: Brief/detailed/technical response options
5. **Language Detection**: Auto-translate non-English sources

### Infrastructure
1. **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Unit tests with mocked APIs, integration tests
2. **Docker Container**: Easy deployment with all dependencies
3. **Configuration Management**: YAML config files for advanced settings
4. **Logging System**: Structured logs for debugging and analytics
5. **Web Interface**: Simple Flask app for browser-based access

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: 24-hour TTL balances freshness with API cost reduction
- **Concurrent Requests**: Could parallelize search and AI calls
- **Token Optimization**: GPT-4o-mini provides good balance of quality/speed/cost
- **Response Limiting**: Configurable number of search results to control costs

## Security Considerations

- API keys stored in environment variables
- No keys in source control (.env in .gitignore)
- Input sanitization for search queries
- No execution of arbitrary code from search results

This implementation demonstrates proficiency in:
- Modern Python development practices
- API integration and error handling
- CLI tool development
- AI/LLM prompt engineering
- User experience design
- Performance optimization techniques
